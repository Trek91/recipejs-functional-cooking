# recipejs-functional-cooking
A functional programming approach to a recipe companion app

This pull request completes Part 1 of the RecipeJS project.

Implemented features:
- Created semantic HTML structure with header and main content area
- Styled UI using modern CSS (flexbox grid, hover effects, gradients)
- Dynamically rendered 8 recipe cards using JavaScript
- Used ES6 features like arrow functions, template literals, and map()
- Added color-coded difficulty badges

This establishes the foundation for future enhancements.
